IN MY OWN WORDS

SORTING ALGORITYMS

Sorting algorithms are a set of procedures that put elements in a certain order. The order could be numerical, lexicographical, or based on some other criteria. There are various sorting algorithms, each with its own advantages and disadvantages in terms of time complexity, space complexity, and ease of implementation.

Bubble sort: 
Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

Insertion sort:
The Insertion Sort algorithm is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort. However, it has several advantages

BIG 0 NOTATION

Big O Notation:
Big O notation is a way to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm in terms of its input size. It provides an upper bound on the growth rate of the runtime of an algorithm in the worst-case scenario.

Here are some common Big O notations:

O(1): Constant time complexity. The algorithm's runtime does not depend on the size of the input.
O(log n): Logarithmic time complexity. Common in algorithms that divide the problem in each step, like binary search.
O(n): Linear time complexity. The runtime grows linearly with the size of the input.
O(n log n): Linearithmic time complexity. Common in efficient sorting algorithms like Merge Sort and Heap Sort.
O(n^2): Quadratic time complexity. Common in algorithms with nested iterations, like Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort.
